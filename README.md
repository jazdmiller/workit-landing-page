## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Frontend toolkit


### What I learned

Completing this project taught me the importance and efficiency of a mobile-first approach. I started with a desk-top first approach and found it tedious to go back and re-adjust elements for smaller screen sizes versus starting with mobile designs and building up.

### Continued development

Next, I would like to implement Framer Motion to add animations and interactivity.


### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Reading through the Bootstrap documentation when I got stuck really helped me learn more about responsive layouts, specifically how to utilize their rows and columns, so I didn't have to rely on vanilla CSS for flexbox and grid.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/SVG_and_CSS) - I utilized MDN to help me understand when and how to use SVG's. I learned how much more accessible and animatable they are when it comes to using graphics on the web.
